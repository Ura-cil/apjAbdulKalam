                <p class="aboutPara color">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) Indian
                    scientist and
                    politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons
                    programs. He was
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
                    Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
                    Organisation, where he was
                    project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and
                    produced in India.
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                    which helped earn him
                    the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which
                    incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
